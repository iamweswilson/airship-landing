                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        Airship is an open source tool used for doing declarative operations and integration of open infrastructure.

                        Airship lets you build a cloud easier than ever before. Whether you’re a telecom, a manufacturer, a health care provider, or an individual developer, Airship makes it easy to predictably build and manage cloud infrastructure. It’s built using microservices, which we think are the future of software development, and embraces cloud native principles out of the box. This allows each Airship microservice to perform one specific role in the cloud delivery and management process, and to do it well. The ultimate goal of Airship is to help operators take hardware from loading dock to an OpenStack cloud, all while ensuring first-class life cycle management of that cloud once it enters production.
