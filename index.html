                        Airship is a collection of loosely coupled but interoperable open source tools that declaratively automate cloud provisioning. Airship is a robust delivery mechanism for organizations who want to embrace containers as the new unit of infrastructure delivery at scale. Starting from raw bare metal infrastructure, Airship manages the full lifecycle of data center infrastructure to deliver a production-grade Kubernetes cluster with Helm deployed artifacts, including OpenStack-Helm.  Airship allows operators to manage their infrastructure deployments and lifecycle through the declarative YAML documents that describe an Airship environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The introduction of containers has led to a revolution in how applications are deployed and maintained through the use of powerful container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Airship applies these principles of application management to datacenter operations. Airship allows operators to declare their entire infrastructure up front. Hard assets, such as bare metal servers and network settings, are managed alongside soft assets, such as the helm charts and application containers.  This declarative approach allows Airship to provide a repeatable, and predictable mechanism for maintaining service-critical infrastructure and the software running there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Airship has a single workflow for managing both initial installations and updates. An operator only needs to make a change to an Airship YAML configuration, and the Airship platform does the rest of the work. When managing complex IaaS projects such as OpenStack, anything from minor service configuration updates to major upgrades are all handled in the same way: by simply modifying the YAML configuration and submitting it to the Airship runtime.

                    <h2>Project News</h2>
                    <p>
                        Today the Airship community features its Release Candidate, ahead of the 1.0 version expected in early 2019. The 1.0 Release Candidate represents a significant milestone, providing a platform that can be (and is) used for the deployment and management of real-world, containerized OpenStack environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The community has been actively developing the release candidate since the project was introduced as an OSF pilot project in May 2018 and has achieved security at scale, scalable operations and reliable upgrades, as well nightly CI/CD validation of integrations and example deployments. The release candidate is ready to try, and the community has developed “Airship in a Bottle,” an easy way to get started. Features on the roadmap for the 1.0 release include thorough documentation and OpenStack Ironic bare metal cloud integration.
