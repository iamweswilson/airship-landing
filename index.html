                    <p>
                        Airship is a collection of interoperable and loosely coupled open source tools that provide for automated cloud provisioning and management in a declarative way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Airship makes managing the life cycle of open infrastructure simple, repeatable, and predictable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Airship helps operators take control of their infrastructure, by providing a declarative framework for defining and managing the life cycle of open infrastructure tools and the hardware below. These tools include OpenStack for Virtual Machines, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and MaaS for bare metal, with support for OpenStack Ironic on the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the largest infrastructure operators in the world, including AT&T and SKT, are actively designing, testing, and deploying Airship to manage their complex infrastructure at scale.
